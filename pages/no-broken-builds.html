<p>Nobody goes home until the build is fixed</p>



<h3>
<a name="no-broken-builds-Motivation"></a>Motivation</h3>


<p>Your build state is your code's heartbeat. A broken build means you're not delivering value, and you certainly don't have production-ready software.</p>


<h3>
<a name="no-broken-builds-Applicability"></a>Applicability</h3>


<p>If you're using a continuous build system (you are, aren't you?), you should have trouble sleeping if the build isn't green.</p>


<h3>
<a name="no-broken-builds-Application"></a>Application</h3>


<p>Ensure you receive automatic alerts when your build breaks and also when it is fixed. If a build is broken it is the responsibility of the <strong>entire team</strong> to ensure the build is fixed. Of course, the person responsible for the checkin that broke the build is the most natural person to delegate this task to, but if s/he is only holiday that's <strong>not</strong> an excuse to ignore the problem!</p>


<h3>
<a name="no-broken-builds-Consequences"></a>Consequences</h3>


<p>If you have a broken build (and certainly if <em>you</em> were responsible for it breaking!) you should feel bad if you're working on anything other than fixing it. If your team starts ignoring build failure notifications - or even starts setting up mail filters for them! - consider if the build setup is still relevant to your project's needs. For instance, there's no point in having a quality build that fails continuously because it is verifying style rules the team is no longer using.</p>



<p>If your failing build(s) <em>are</em> still relevant to your project and the team is ignoring them <em>anyway</em>, raise the alarm.</p>

<a name="no-broken-builds-References"></a>References</h3>


<p>There are also a number of "build league tables" and other plugins  for many continuous build tools that can make keeping the build green a  bit more fun and exciting.</p>
