<h3 id="fail-fast-Motivation">Motivation</h3>


<p>Projects fail. That itself is not an problem. In many cases, figuring out if an idea is feasible in the long run would take as much time as giving it a go. So you give it a go, and if fails. Though luck. </p>


<p>The big problem however is that projects fail <em>late in the game</em>. That means piles of money were spent on something that - with a little bit of effort - could have been proven to be a failure early on. And that's just plain wrong. Projects should fail as early as possible, if there is a risk it might fail.</p>


<p>Edsger Dijkstra once said that whenever he had an idea, he first put in a considerable amount of effort to proof it wrong. </p>

<p>All projects. But it extends well beyond the boundaries of projects. It also applies to the inner workings of software. If there is a chance it fail, make it fail as early as possible.</p>


<h3 id="fail-fast-Application">Application</h3>


<ul>
	
<li>Have a list of risks</li>
	
<li>Estimate the chance that the risk materializes into a problem</li>
	
<li>Estimate the cost incurred as a consequence of that problem</li>
	
<li>Prioritize work to deal with the risks</li>
	
<li>Make it visible. Having a calendar on the wall that clearly highlights the risks and the moment in time we expected to have dealt with it might help.</li>

</ul>
