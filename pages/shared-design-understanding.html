<h3 id="shared-design-understanding-Motivation">Motivation</h3>


<p>Having no shared understanding of what you are jointly aiming for is a recipe for disaster:</p>


<ul>
	
<li>Conceptual integrity will be broken.</li>
	
<li>The discussion will slide to your code base.</li>
	
<li>Which will eventually turn your code base into a battle ground.</li>
	
<li>It's not uncommon people will undo the changes of others, thinking it is not the <em>right</em> way - mind you, without a joined agreement on what constitutes 'the right way'.</li>

</ul>



<h3 id="shared-design-understanding-Applicability">Applicability</h3>


<p>It applies on all levels of the IT organization, but most certainly to development teams. </p>


<h3 id="shared-design-understanding-Application">Application</h3>


<p>There are a couple of things you can do to increase a shared understanding of the design objectives. </p>


<ul>
	
<li>
<em>Pair programming helps</em>: even though it synchronizes between two people only, if you switch pairs <em>frequently</em>, and if you prevent your team members from getting too attached to a particular area of the code base, you will eventually get a shared design understanding.</li>
	
<li>
<em>Joint design discussion</em>: as soon as you notice blank stares when discussing a particular area of the code base, you should step up and demand allocating some time to discuss that part of the codebase.</li>
	
<li>
<em>Plaster the walls</em>: any material coming out of the design discussions should be on the wall. And it should be updated if it no longer reflects the current understanding.</li>

</ul>



<h3 id="shared-design-understanding-Consequences">Consequences</h3>


<p>A shared understanding of the design will help people understand the consequences of their actions. Not having a shared understanding of the design will quickly cause people to claim a certain portion of the code base they understand, which eventually will result in a fragmented code base without any conceptual integrity at all. </p>


<p>Having design meetings of course is expensive. Having some preparation might help, but pictures drawn <em>during</em> the meeting normally have a longer lasting effect. And you should keep in mind that ideas captured during preparation might turn out to be invalid during the discussion. </p>


<p>The advice is <em>not</em> to have design discussions during the stand-up, but perhaps right after it. Somebody should take the responsibility to make sure the results are captured on the wall. </p>
